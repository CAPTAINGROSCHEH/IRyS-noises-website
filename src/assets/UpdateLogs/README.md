# Lists of audios added during each update

You can find here lists of audios that were added during the update corresponding to the files' names dates.
Some old audios' names could have been updated, which means **some audios' names in the oldest lists can be outdated** but **no audios should have been deleted** unless I point them out in one of those lists.
